📄 Project Description:
This project demonstrates a secure and production-friendly approach to handling
database passwords in Python applications.
It includes:
● 🔐 Password encryption using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
● 🛡 Safe decryption at runtime with protection against accidental leaks (print/log
masking)
● ⚙️ Actual MySQL database connection using the decrypted password
● 📁 Clean modular code organization for real-world project structure
🧱 Tech Stack:
● Language: Python 3
● Database: MySQL
● Libraries:
○ cryptography – for encryption and decryption
○ mysql-connector-python – to connect to MySQL from Python
